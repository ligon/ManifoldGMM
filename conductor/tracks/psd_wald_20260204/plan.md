# Implementation Plan: Wald Test Comparison on Fixed-Rank PSD Manifold

## Phase 1: Simulation and Comparison [checkpoint: e10894c]

- [x] Task: Implement Monte Carlo simulation for PSD Manifold vs Euclidean e10894c
    - [x] Write Tests: Create `tests/econometrics/test_psd_wald_comparison.py`
    - [x] Implement Feature: Compare size and power curves
- [x] Task: Document results in a new example
    - [x] Implement Feature: Create `docs/examples/psd_fixed_rank_inference.org` with plots
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Simulation and Comparison' (Protocol in workflow.md)
