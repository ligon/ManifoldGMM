# Implementation Plan: Wald Test Comparison on Fixed-Rank PSD Manifold

## Phase 1: Simulation and Comparison

- [~] Task: Implement Monte Carlo simulation for PSD Manifold vs Euclidean
    - [ ] Write Tests: Create `tests/econometrics/test_psd_wald_comparison.py`
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Compare size and power curves
- [ ] Task: Document results in a new example
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Create `docs/examples/psd_fixed_rank_inference.org` with plots
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Simulation and Comparison' (Protocol in workflow.md)
