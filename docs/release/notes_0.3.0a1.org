* Summary
This alpha refresh focuses on inference ergonomics and documentation. We now
carry manifold-aware parameter estimates throughout the API, added formatted
arithmetic helpers, and captured the design for forthcoming confidence-region
machinery.

* Highlights
- Stored =GMMResult.theta= as a =ManifoldPoint= and introduced
  =theta_labeled=/=theta_array= accessors that hydrate formatted views on
  demand while keeping ambient coordinates handy for numerics.
- Extended =ManifoldPoint= with optional formatted payloads so scalar math,
  NumPy coercion, and attribute access delegate to labelled =DataVec=/=DataMat=
  representations when available.
- Logged the confidence-region blueprint in
  [[file:../design/confidence_regions.org][docs/design/confidence_regions.org]], outlining χ² contour tracing,
  reporting modes, and numerical safeguards for on-manifold uncertainty
  quantification.
- Hardened the automation log and examples to reflect the new helpers, keeping
  tests green across Euclidean and curved manifolds.

* Breaking/Notable Changes
- Callers expecting =result.theta= to be a plain array must switch to
  =result.theta_array=. The object is now a =ManifoldPoint= with arithmetic
  delegated to labelled data structures.
- Weighting callables that only accepted raw arrays should be updated to handle
  =ManifoldPoint= inputs (or extract =.value=).

* Verification
- =make quick-check=
- =make slow-tests=
- =poetry build=

* Pending Before Final Tag
- Wire the documented confidence-region algorithms into the public API.
- Evaluate whether =datamat==0.2.0a1= remains the appropriate pin ahead of a
  wider beta.

* Acknowledgements
Thanks to Ethan Ligon for steering the manifold inference plan and ensuring the
collaboration preferences remain front and centre during the refactor.
