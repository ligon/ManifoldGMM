* Summary
This alpha release introduces the first end-to-end example of GMM estimation on
manifolds, wiring =MomentRestriction= into the new =GMM= estimator and providing
a reproducible product-manifold walkthrough.

* Highlights
- Added =GMM= class with support for continuously updated and two-step weighting.
- Ensured degrees of freedom respect the intrinsic dimension of manifold blocks.
- Delivered a Gaussian location/covariance example that solves on both Euclidean
  and SPD manifolds (tangled to =examples/gaussian_covariance.py=).
- Expanded documentation on translating =DataMat= observation moments to JAX.
- Introduced build tooling for fast (=make quick-check=) and slow (=make slow-tests=) suites.
- Pinned the =datamat= dependency to the published =0.2.0a1= release while
  keeping an easy switch to a local editable install for co-development.

* Breaking/Notable Changes
- Tests that exercise long-running optimisations are now marked =@pytest.mark.slow=.
- The default quick-check workflow excludes slow tests; CI and release workflows
  should invoke both =make quick-check= and =make slow-tests=.

* Pending Before Final Tag
- Pin to an official =DataMat= release once published.
- Add inference routines and tighten tolerances in the Gaussian example.
- Run packaging smoke tests (=poetry build=, install in clean env).

* Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to Ethan Ligon for guidance on MomentRestriction semantics and
example structure.
