#+TITLE: Collaboration Preferences (ligon)
#+AUTHOR: ManifoldGMM Maintainers
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

These notes capture the working habits and idiosyncrasies that Ethan (“ligon”)
has asked agents to follow when collaborating inside *ManifoldGMM*. The list is
meant to be a quick reminder; future contributors can extend or override it with
their own profile if needed.

* Tooling defaults
- Run ``make quick-check`` instead of ad-hoc lint/test invocations. The target
  wraps ``ruff``, ``black``, ``mypy``, and ``pytest`` (respecting the ``FILES=``
  override) so every change sees the same battery.
- Explicitly narrate the check → diagnose → fix cycle. When a tool fails,
  summarize the error and outline the proposed fix before editing; after the fix,
  re-run the check and report the outcome.

* Documentation style
- Use **American spellings** (vectorize, optimization, etc.) in docs that we
  author for Ethan.
- Avoid Unicode math in Org-mode examples unless strictly necessary; prefer
  ``\[ ... \]`` or ``\begin{equation}...\end{equation}`` delimiters for display
  math.

* Code authoring habits
- Default to DataMat/DataVec interfaces in user-facing examples, even when a JAX
  twin is required; the JAX version can be derived as a companion.
- For JAX conversions, consult the how-to in ``docs/howto/datamat_to_jax.org``
  and use the validation helper from ``tests/utils/datamat_to_jax.py``.

* Communication
- When encountering unexpected behaviours (tooling failures, missing packages,
  etc.), surface them immediately along with the planned remediation instead of
  silently patching.

This file can grow as collaboration preferences evolve. Feel free to add dated
entries or create sibling files (e.g., ``collaboration_preferences_{handle}.org``)
for other maintainers.
