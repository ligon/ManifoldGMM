#+TITLE: Collaboration Preferences (ligon)
#+AUTHOR: ManifoldGMM Maintainers
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

These notes capture the working habits and idiosyncrasies that Ethan (“ligon”)
has asked agents to follow when collaborating inside *ManifoldGMM*. The list is
meant to be a quick reminder; future contributors can extend or override it with
their own profile if needed.

* Tooling defaults
- Run =make quick-check= instead of ad-hoc lint/test invocations. The target
  wraps =ruff=, =black=, =mypy=, and =pytest= (respecting the =FILES=
  override) so every change sees the same battery.
- Explicitly narrate the check → diagnose → fix cycle. When a tool fails,
  summarize the error and outline the proposed fix before editing; after the fix,
  re-run the check and report the outcome.
- Follow the maxim *“commit early and often”*—create a dedicated branch for any
  substantive change, commit in small increments, and only merge once the branch
  is ready.
- Push less frequently: batch multiple commits before running the full pre-push
  harness, since the local checks and CI pipeline are relatively expensive.
- Ensure Emacs ≥ 28 is available locally for editing and exporting Org-mode
  documentation.
- Git history :: Do not rewrite git history or amend commit messages once they
  are published locally.

* Documentation style
- American spellings :: Use American spellings (vectorize, optimization, etc.)
  in docs that we author for Ethan.
- ASCII math :: Avoid Unicode math in Org-mode examples unless strictly
  necessary; prefer =\[ ... \]= or =\begin{equation}...\end{equation}= delimiters
  for display math.
- Org description lists :: Use Org description lists (= - Term :: detail=) rather
  than styling bullets with bolded headings.
- Org inline code :: Write variable or identifier names with =identifier=
  instead of Markdown backticks.

* Code authoring habits
- Default to DataMat/DataVec interfaces in user-facing examples, even when a JAX
  twin is required; the JAX version can be derived as a companion.
- For JAX conversions, consult the how-to in =docs/howto/datamat_to_jax.org=
  and use the validation helper from =tests/utils/datamat_to_jax.py=.

* Communication
- When encountering unexpected behaviours (tooling failures, missing packages,
  etc.), surface them immediately along with the planned remediation instead of
  silently patching.
- The phrase *“Remember the maxim”* signals a pause to review this document,
  confirm the current preferences are being honoured, and add any new nuance
  gleaned from the context (after checking that the note is not already present).

This file can grow as collaboration preferences evolve. Feel free to add dated
entries or create sibling files (e.g., =collaboration_preferences_{handle}.org=)
for other maintainers.
