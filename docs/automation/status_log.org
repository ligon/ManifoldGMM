#+TITLE: Agent Status Log

#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

* Session Summary
- Date: <2025-10-27 Mon>
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Focus: Streamline quick-check workflow and document heavier tests.

* Notes
1. Updated =Makefile= so =quick-check= runs unit tests excluding =@pytest.mark.slow= cases and added a dedicated =slow-tests= target.
2. Tagged =tests/econometrics/test_gaussian_example.py= with the =slow= marker and registered it in =pyproject.toml=.
3. Confirmed =make quick-check= succeeds, recorded that =tests/econometrics/test_gaussian_example.py= takes â‰ˆ11.7s via =pytest --durations=10=, and created this log entry to track the session.
4. Pinned =datamat= to =0.2.0a1= and added a convenience target (=make use-local-datamat=) for opting into an editable local install during development.

* Recommended Follow-ups
- Evaluate whether other tests should receive the =slow= marker as the suite grows.
- Decide if status logs should be rotated per release or maintained cumulatively.

* Session Summary
- Date: <2025-10-27 Mon>
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Focus: Finalise tangent/inference utilities and dependency hygiene.

* Notes
1. Introduced Jacobian and covariance helpers on =GMMResult=, including ridge-stabilised inversion utilities.
2. Added circle-mean regression/Org example, verified tangent vs ambient covariance consistency, and wrote persistence helpers for pickling results.
3. Updated documentation index/readme to reference new examples and clarified collaboration preferences about Org formatting.
4. Regenerated dependencies to include =cloudpickle= (used for robust pickle support) while removing the non-installable emacs placeholder.

* Recommended Follow-ups
- Expose convenience accessors for standard errors and Wald-style tests now that covariances are available.
- Document a pattern for constrained GMM fits to enable LR-style tests in future work.
