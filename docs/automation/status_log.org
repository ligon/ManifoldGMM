* Session Summary
- Date: <2025-10-27 Mon>
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Focus: Streamline quick-check workflow and document heavier tests.

* Notes
1. Updated =Makefile= so =quick-check= runs unit tests excluding =@pytest.mark.slow= cases and added a dedicated =slow-tests= target.
2. Tagged =tests/econometrics/test_gaussian_example.py= with the =slow= marker and registered it in =pyproject.toml=.
3. Confirmed =make quick-check= succeeds, recorded that =tests/econometrics/test_gaussian_example.py= takes â‰ˆ11.7s via =pytest --durations=10=, and created this log entry to track the session.
4. Pinned =datamat= to =0.2.0a1= and added a convenience target (=make use-local-datamat=) for opting into an editable local install during development.

* Recommended Follow-ups
- Evaluate whether other tests should receive the =slow= marker as the suite grows.
- Decide if status logs should be rotated per release or maintained cumulatively.
