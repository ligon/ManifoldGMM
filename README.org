* ManifoldGMM: GMM Estimation on Riemannian Manifolds
ManifoldGMM is a Python package for performing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
estimation when parameters live on smooth (Riemannian) manifolds.  It extends
=pymanopt= with Jacobian support and provides a high-level econometric interface.

** Highlights
- Builds directly on the geometry of manifolds (e.g., Stiefel, PSD-FixedRank)
- Provides GMM estimation and inference that respect manifold structure
- Ships with example walkthroughs for Gaussian covariance (product manifold) and circular means on \(\mathbb{S}^1\)
- Supports automatic differentiation via JAX or Autograd
- Designed for reproducible research and extension by humans or LLM assistants

** Quick Overview
- *Geometry layer*: defines =Manifold=, =ManifoldPoint=, and =TangentSpace=
- *Econometrics layer*: defines =GMM=, weighting-matrix updates, and inference
- *Documentation*: in Org-mode under =docs/=

** Developer Standards
All contributors (including automated assistants) must follow the
[[file:docs/standards/naming_notation.org][Naming & Notation Standards]]
for mathematical symbols, API naming, and documentation conventions.
Automated assistants must also adhere to the policies in [[file:AGENTS.org][AGENTS.org]].

** Example Walkthroughs
- Gaussian location/covariance on a product manifold :: [[file:docs/examples/gaussian_location_covariance.org][docs/examples/gaussian_location_covariance.org]]
- Circle mean inference on \(\mathbb{S}^1\) :: [[file:docs/examples/circular_mean_inference.org][docs/examples/circular_mean_inference.org]]

** Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.11 (e.g., via pyenv).
2. Install Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
3. Install Emacs 28 or newer (needed for Org-mode editing/export).
4. Create the virtual environment in the project root (JAX is installed automatically):
   #+begin_src bash
   poetry env use 3.11
   poetry install --with dev
   #+end_src
5. Run quality checks and the test suite.  The =quick-check= target skips tests
   marked as slow so you can iterate quickly; run =slow-tests= before releasing.
   #+begin_src bash
   make quick-check
   make slow-tests
   #+end_src
   For the full battery (including formatting against the entire repository),
   continue to use =make check=.

** Working with a local =DataMat= checkout
- The pinned dependency is =datamat==0.2.0a1=, ensuring reproducible installs.
- When co-developing against a sibling clone (e.g., =../DataMat=), run:
  #+begin_src bash
  make use-local-datamat
  #+end_src
  which installs the local repository in editable mode inside the Poetry
  environment. Remember to reinstall the pinned release (e.g.,
  =poetry install=) before committing or publishing a new ManifoldGMM release.
