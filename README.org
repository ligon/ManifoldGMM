* ManifoldGMM: GMM Estimation on Riemannian Manifolds
ManifoldGMM is a Python package for performing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)
estimation when parameters live on smooth (Riemannian) manifolds.  It extends
=pymanopt= with Jacobian support and provides a high-level econometric interface.

** Highlights
- Builds directly on the geometry of manifolds (e.g., Stiefel, PSD-FixedRank)
- Provides GMM estimation and inference that respect manifold structure
- Supports automatic differentiation via JAX or Autograd
- Designed for reproducible research and extension by humans or LLM assistants

** Quick Overview
- *Geometry layer*: defines =Manifold=, =ManifoldPoint=, and =TangentSpace=
- *Econometrics layer*: defines =GMM=, weighting-matrix updates, and inference
- *Documentation*: in Org-mode under =docs/=

** Developer Standards
All contributors (including automated assistants) must follow the
[[file:docs/standards/naming_notation.org][Naming & Notation Standards]]
for mathematical symbols, API naming, and documentation conventions.
Automated assistants must also adhere to the policies in [[file:AGENTS.org][AGENTS.org]].

** Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.11 (e.g., via pyenv).
2. Install Poetry (https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
3. Create the virtual environment in the project root (include the =jax= extra for autodiff work):
   #+begin_src bash
   poetry env use 3.11
   poetry install --extras jax --with dev
   #+end_src
4. Run quality checks and the test suite:
   #+begin_src bash
   poetry run ruff check .
   poetry run black --check .
   poetry run mypy src tests
   poetry run pytest
   # or simply run
   make check
   #+end_src
